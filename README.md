# PyFBP (Uncompleted project)

Python Flow Based Programming project, that I wrote in parallel with reading "Flow Based Programming" book written by J. Paul Morrison (http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/index_old.shtml)

This project has no end and it was a private until now, so I decided to share it with public and hopefully will implement some other ideas here sooner or later.

This is a standalone Python project, that requires no extra packages or specific environment.

I wrote it with Python 2.7, so you might need to change some specific lines of code (usually it's **print** command).

Feel free to fork it, modify it, remove it, explode it, melt it, smash it or cook it \m/_
